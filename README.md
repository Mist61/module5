In the Calc class is it using methods for adding,multiplying,dividing,subtracting,as well as division by 0 the amount, 
these methods takes the double and tests them for the expected result in the CalcTest Class.
it also test the division by zero as that is not possible it will pass all the test, 
and will output if zero is inputed cannot divide by zero,
each test validates each method is corrct.

In the Bank Class is it using methods for depositing,withdrawing,checking incorrect inputs,
in the BankTest Class it is testing for each withdrawel,deposit, adding or subtracting from the balance
it also checks if the number inputed is invalid such as a negative number for a desposit, 
which then doesnt allow for the deposit to go throw 
which outputs cannot deposit a negative number
it also checks if the number inputed is greater the balance amount, 
which then doesnt allow you to withdraw more than the amount in the account
